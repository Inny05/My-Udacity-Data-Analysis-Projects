# (Ford GoBikes Data Analysis)

## FordGoBikes Sysytem Data Exploration

>The Ford Gobike dataset contains information about individual rides made in a bike sharing company. I cleaned the dataset by dropping columns that contianed missing values. I also converting the columns with time values from integers to datetime datatypes and I converted columns like user type, bike sharing and member gender to categorical datatypes.


## Summary of Findings

> Customers travel the same duration regardles the day of the week. Only subscribers can bike share on all trips, with over 90% of the trips taken by subscribers and 90% of the trips were not bike sharing for only trips. We have the most trips on weekdays, with the most number of rides on Thurdays, which accounts for 19.3% of the trips and the most number of trips between 8am-9am and 4pm -5pm. Fewer number of trips were taken on weekends,  which are Saturday 8.2% and Sunday 8.3%. 
There are less bike rides on the weekends and more bike rides during the week.



## Key Insights for Presentation

> For this presentation, I chose to focus on the relationship between, the days of the week, the duration of the trips and the bike sharing option.
The most rides recorded on Thursdays and the least recorded on Saturdays and Sundays.  Non-bike sharing trips had the most number of trips everyday of the week and bike sharers had fewer number of trips. The longest duration of trips were taken by those who opted to bike sharing everyday of the week and shorter trips were recorded by non-bike sharers, but recorded longer durations during the weekends.
